# Question

What is a Higher Order Function?

# Answer

<!-- The function called within a function is called a Higher Order Function. It allows for a second function for seperating purposes to avoid repeated code. DRYer - Dont reapeat yourself. -->

A HOF is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as a result.

Key take away

A higher-order function that returns a function as its result is simply returning a function, not a callback.
