# Question

What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer

It is being called because of the () when instead we need to use it as a call function so just get rid of ()
nums.forEach(printDouble);
